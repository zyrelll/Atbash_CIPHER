# Atbash_CIPHER
Cryptography: atbash

This cipher gets its name from the Hebrew
alphabet. The first letter of the Hebrew
alphabet is “aleph”, which gets encrypted
to the last letter, “taw”. The second letter of
the Hebrew alphabet is “bet”, which gets
encrypted to the second-last letter, “shin”.
Putting these four letters together gives
something which sounds like “atbash”.

# Alphabet

The alphabet for Modern English is a Latin-script alphabet consisting of 26 letters, each having an upper- and lower-case form. The word alphabet is a compound of the first two letters of the Greek alphabet, alpha and beta. The alphabet originated around the 7th century to write Old English from Latin script. Since then, letters have been added or removed to give the current letters:

A aB bC cD dE eF fG gH hI iJ jK kL lM mN nO oP pQ qR rS sT tU uV vW wX xY yZ z
The exact shape of printed letters varies depending on the typeface (and font), and the standard printed form may differ significantly from the shape of handwritten letters (which varies between individuals), especially cursive.

The English alphabet has 5 vowels, 19 consonants, and 2 letters (Y and W) that can function as consonants or vowels.

Written English has a large number of digraphs, such as ch, ea, oo, sh, and th. Within the languages used in Europe, English stands out in not normally using diacritics in native words.
