# Atbash_CIPHER
Cryptography: atbash

This cipher gets its name from the Hebrew
alphabet. The first letter of the Hebrew
alphabet is “aleph”, which gets encrypted
to the last letter, “taw”. The second letter of
the Hebrew alphabet is “bet”, which gets
encrypted to the second-last letter, “shin”.
Putting these four letters together gives
something which sounds like “atbash”.
